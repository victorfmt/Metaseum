# METASEUM

- About:

Metaseum is a 3D WEB APP that allows the user to explore a native browser 3D environment while learning historical facts about the objects and places they encounter in their journey. The user can select and collect any objects of their choosing. The user can create their own gallery and share their curated collections with other users. 

- Tech Stuff:

Metaseum was developed using React, Flask, SQL, and Babylon.JS. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this program is that 3D objects in .gltf format are stored in SQL database as strings allowing for multiple databases and economical ways to store complex 3D objects.
